# Pneumonia Detection Web Application (Java JEE)

A Java JEE web application that connects suspected pneumonia patients with their doctors. Patients can enter their personal information, view their details, upload chest X-ray images, and review doctor reports. Doctors can sign in, access the patient list, confirm AI model analysis of X-ray images, and generate reports.
